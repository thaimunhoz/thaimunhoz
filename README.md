Hello, I'm Thainara 😊

<p align="justify"> I have a bachelor's degree in Cartography and Surveying Engineering (University of São Paulo State - Brazil). During my graduation period, I was a FAPESP (São Paulo Research Foundation) fellow in the area of Satellite Positioning (GNSS), where I worked on the mathematical modeling of atmospheric effects that decreases GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) accuracy. During this period, I also worked as a research student at the University of New Brunswick (UNB) – Canada. Currently, I am a Master's student in Remote Sensing at the National Institute of Space Research – INPE. Funded by FAPESP, I have been working on the development/calibration of algorithms to assess water quality parameters using remote sensing data. Recently, I was also an exchange student at the National Research Council of Italy - Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (CNR-IREA) in Milan, where I worked on the application of hyperspectral sensors and machine learning models in the study of inland waters. Since then, I’ve been collaborating with CNR-IREA on different projects. I do bring along a background in Remote Sensing, Geodesy, Photogrammetry, Geomatics Engineering, Surveying Engineering, Geo-informatics, and Geo-information science. Knowledge of aerial image processing and photogrammetry; coordinate systems and reference frames; GNSS/INS principles; RADAR images processing; Processing of Airborne LiDAR data; proﬁciency in the use of GIS and surveying software, and knowledge in digital image processing; and advanced knowledge in programming languages (Python, Matlab, R), machine learning and deep learning models, and database (SQL).
I am empathic, curious, collaborative, and an innovation enthusiast, which truly believes that our generation is the one responsible to create a more sustainable, diverse, and inclusive environment for future generations.
