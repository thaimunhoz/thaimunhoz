Hello, I'm Thainara 😊

<p align="justify"> I’m a PhD student in Biosystems Engineering at Mississippi State University, supervised by Dr. Vitor Martins. My PhD project, funded by the NASA Early Career Research Program, focuses on the global mapping of algal blooms in coastal waters using artificial intelligence. My research focuses on aquatic remote sensing, computer vision, and deep learning to develop scalable tools for monitoring and managing water resources from satellite observations.
I hold a master’s degree in Remote Sensing from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), Brazil, where I focused on calibrating bio-optical models using satellite data. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Geomatics and Surveying Engineering from São Paulo State University (UNESP), with a focus on GNSS, atmospheric modeling, and remote sensing. I have collaborated with research groups at the University of New Brunswick and the National Research Council of Italy (CNR-IREA), where I worked with hyperspectral data and deep learning for inland water applications.

Let’s dive in and explore the work I’m passionate about!
